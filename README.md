# -Big-Data-in-Social-Media-Analytics
This project delves into the multifaceted domain of social media analytics, leveraging unstructured data from six distinct sources: Reddit, web scraping, expert discussions, TED Talks, and image scraping. Our comprehensive analysis aims to uncover critical insights and trends within the realm of big data as it pertains to social media.

Thematic Analysis:
We conducted a thematic analysis of existing literature on big data in social media from 2021 to 2024. Utilizing the Bibliometrix R-package, we implemented science mapping techniques such as co-citation, coupling, and co-word analysis to identify emerging research trends and potential gaps in the field. This systematic review encompassed relevant academic articles and industry reports sourced from databases like Scopus.

Data Funneling with Sentiment Analysis:
Focusing on the retail industry and shareholders' perspectives, we collected pertinent social media data and performed sentiment analysis. This process categorized the data into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments regarding big data practices. By funneling this sentiment data, we identified prominent themes and concerns expressed by shareholders, offering valuable insights into public opinion and industry sentiment.

ISM and MICMAC Analysis:
To further analyze the data, we utilized Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and MICMAC analysis. ISM provided a visualization of the interdependencies between identified themes, highlighting their relationships and potential impact. MICMAC analysis categorized these factors based on their driving power, dependence, autonomy, and influence, thus elucidating which factors hold the most sway in shaping shareholder concerns.
